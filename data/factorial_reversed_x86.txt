In the age of Duskborn Letting thy grace of feed shine upon pure golden needle here will thunder in the darkest night ;
The fallen leaves tell us a story of the feed shine upon the ring of  seed 
{
	And when the stars will fall along with the ring of  seed equal with rune of Death , bless them with 
	{
		Bless thy tarnished with Starling amber ;
	};
	And when the stars will fall along with the ring of  seed equal with Starling amber , bless them with 
	{
		Bless thy tarnished with Starling amber ;
	};
	Bless thy tarnished with the ring of  seed enchanted with Letting thy grace of feed shine upon the ring of  seed shadowed by Starling amber here ;
};
